              "text": "Cambay Basin is one of the prolific hydrocarbon producing sedimentary basins of India covering an area of about 53500 Sq. Km. including the area within the Gulf of Cambay. Out of this large area, the prospective area works out to be about 35000 Sq. Km with 2585 MMT of hydrocarbon resources. Exploratory activities in Cambay Basin were initiated in the year 1958. As on date 2841 exploratory wells have been drilled, out of which 122 discoveries have been found to be oil/gas bearing. As on 01.04.2022, 301 structures/prospects have been drilled, out of which 113 structures were oil/gas bearing fields. Out of these fields, 92 are with ONGC and balance 21 oil/gas fields have been awarded to private companies by GOI for development and contracts have been signed by ONGC with various consortiums. The prognosticated resources are to the tune of 2585MMtOE (incl. Gulf of Cambay). The established in-place hydrocarbons (O+OEG) amount to 1802 MMt, (as per DGH annual report 2019-20). Initially in-place volume accreted so far is about 1705.28 MMt (O+OEG) from ONGC operated fields, the ultimate reserve 538.70 MMt and the cumulative production so far is 359.52 MMt from the producing Assets at Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Ankleshwar and Cambay."

It is a linear, sigmoidal, NNW-SSE trending rift basin and covers an area between latitudes 21°00’ and 25°00’ N and longitudes 71°30’ and 73°15’ E. The length of the basin is about 425 km and width varies from 40 km in north to about 100 km in south inferring northward diminishing of rift propagation. The area of the basin is 53,500 square km extending from Sanchor in the north to Surat in the south. It is bounded by Luni River in the north and Tapti River in the South, Saurashtra Arch in the west and Aravalli-Delhi ranges and Deccan Carton in the east. The basin opens up into the Gulf of Cambay (Khambhat)/ Daman offshore in the south and southwest. Southern part of the basin lies offshore of Gulf of Cambay and passes to SSW into the Bombay Offshore Basin in the Arabian Sea. To the north of Sanchor, the basin is separated from Rajasthan Basin by a basement swell. Extensional faulting created tilted fault-blocks and horst-and graben structures parallel to the basin margin."

During 2015-16, Well CRNL-3 was drilled and abandoned and Well CRNL-4 was drilled in 2016-17 and abandoned.
