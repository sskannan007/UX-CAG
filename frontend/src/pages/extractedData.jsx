      "content": "#### II: UNDUE BENEFIT TO CONTRACTOR IN REFILLING WORK\n\nThe work “the construction of new Secretariat for the State of Telangana in the premises of old secretariat complex” was technically sanctioned (September 2020) for ₹617.00 crore. On call of tenders, the work was awarded (November 2020) to M/s Sharpoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, for an agreement value of ₹514.75 crore at 4.02 percent excess over the ECV for completion in 12 months. Scrutiny of the records revealed the following:\n\n#### Undue benefit to contractor in refilling work-₹0.67 crore\n\nAgreement conditions (clause 37 and clause 39) stipulate that the contractor is to be paid for the quantity of the work done at the estimate rate in the bill of quantity of the work done for each item plus or minus tender percentage. The payment rates for supplemental items which are not covered in the agreement are only to be regulated according to the conditions stipulated in the agreement.\n\nThe scope of the work provides for refilling with available excavated earth in low lying areas and in trenches, sides of foundations and basement etc. The sanctioned rate for refilling with available excavated soil was ₹52 per cum (Sl.No.15 of the original estimate) and the corresponding rate with conveyance of material within 1 km was ₹ 87 per cum (Sl. No. 6 of the original estimate). The rates were correctly arrived at in the original estimate by taking the Standard data (BLD-CSTN-2-9). The contractor was also made aware of the sanctioned rates of refilling items of works in the pre-bid meeting. However, later the Department chose to revise the rate at ₹ 427 per cum for refilling with available excavated earth from the dump yard with 1 km by adding some other elements of compaction charges etc discarding the Standard Data in the deviation statement-I (March 2022). This resulted in undue benefit of ₹ 0.67 crore to the contractor.\n\n\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that work items (Sl. No. 6 and 15) of the original estimate pertain to the filling/refilling of useful available earth by manual means. As no machinery component was taken into consideration in the original estimate, new data was prepared considering loading charges, conveyances, and compaction charges.\n\nThe reply is not correct as the building data standard available for refilling with useful excavated earth is common for all works. It is nowhere mentioned that data is for manual means. According to specifications 309 and 310 of APDSS, filling should be done in layers not exceeding 150 mm, each layer being watered and compacted before the succeeding layer is laid. Building standard data approved by the Government was based on the consideration of these specifications. These specifications are also mentioned in the description of the item of work. As stated above, the contractor was also already made aware of the sanctioned rates of this item in the pre-bid meeting. Hence, the revising of the rates on unsubstantiated grounds was incorrect and excess payment should be recovered under intimation to audit.\n\n#### Undue benefit to contractor in carting of the material\n\nThe general method followed for arriving at the rate for carting of excavated soil or rock is to apply the conveyance rate provided in the Schedule of Rates (SoR) according to the extent of lead (conveyance) required. Loading and unloading charges of the carted material are not payable for conveyance by mechanical means for disposal of excavated material unless specified as per the revised Standard Data (Building). The method was correctly applied in the original estimate while arriving at the rate for earth work in excavation including carting of excavated material for depositing at a place within 1 km distance (Sl.No.1 of the original estimate) also in refilling with excavated material by re-carting (Sl.No.6 of the original estimate) without loading charges and unloading charges. However, deviating from the general method approved in the original estimate, the Department decided to manipulate the data in the internal carting of excavated material within 1 km by including loading and unloading charges. This resulted in undue benefit of ₹44.86 lakh to the contractor.\n\n\n\nOn this being pointed out, Department replied that during construction, the excavated material from all blocks was carted and stacked at the new location ie Northeast corner and a new data was prepared duly considering the loading, unloading and conveyance of excavated material with an initial lead of 1 km by mechanical means.\n\nHowever, the matter of fact is that loading and unloading charges of the carted material are not payable for conveyance by mechanical means for disposal of excavated material unless specified as per the revised Standard Data (Building). Department should not have a fluctuating stand as far as this data/rate analysis of internal carting/disposal of excavated earth/rock is concerned. The technical sanctioning authority should not entertain the revision of rates by deviating from the Standard Data approved by the Government. In case of a necessary amendment to the Standard Data, the matter may be placed before the Board of Chief Engineers (BoCE) for consideration of amendment. Interestingly, the same Technical Sanctioning Authority approved the rates of carting/disposal of earth/rock without loading and unloading in the works of Telangana Martyrs Memorial.",

      "content": "#### III. FINALISATION OF RATE OF MACHINE CUTTING CHARGES OF RED/BEIGE SANDSTONE ON POSSIBLE FABRICATED QUOTATION\n\nThe work “Erection of 125 feet tall statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar at Hillock area of NTR garden premises, Hyderabad was technically sanctioned (January 2021) for ₹146.50 crore. On call of tenders, the work was awarded (June 2021) to M/s KPC Projects limited, Hyderabad for an agreement value of ₹104.19 crore at 3.94 percent excess over the estimated contract value. The work was stipulated to be completed in 12 months.\n\nIn the original estimate an amount of ₹20 core was provided for construction of the Main building for the Project. However, subsequently the cost of the building was increased to ₹31.56 crore which was more than 50 percent of the original amount. One of the main reasons for the increase in cost was the revision of rates for sandstone works. Scrutiny of the records revealed that, rate provided for red sandstone work in the estimate was ₹50941 per cum. The rate was however revised at ₹ 2,07,901.98 per cum (August 2023) by adopting a revised data. The revised data was also applied for other similar stonework viz beige sandstone for columns and parapet walls. The main factor for increasing the cost of item of the work was the inclusion of the cutting charges of the stone at ₹970 per sft (quotation rate) and its consequential conversion of the rate at ₹143704 per cum (₹970 per sft/0.00675) in the revised rate. Scrutiny revealed that rate of the cutting charge at ₹970 per sft was approved based on the quotations received from the three firms/suppliers viz (i) RBS Construction, Hyderabad (ii) GOSTONEART, Hindaun city, Rajasthan (iii) Shivansh stone, Hindaun City, Hyderabad. However, none of the suppliers mentioned the dates of the quotation and validity period of the rates in the quotation letters. The Audit also observed that the description of work and letter format and font size of letters in the quotation letters furnished by suppliers were one and same, indicating the possible fabrication of the quotation letters. Further, one of the quotations mentioned the unit of rate in terms of cubic metre while another two in square feet and comparative statement was prepared assuming all units in square feet.\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that after the agreement was concluded, certain changes such as locating the statue on Hillock and direction of statue were finalized after deliberations with Higher Authorities in Government and the work was grounded thereafter on 02.09.2021. And also submitted that a decision was taken to get the project completed on war footing and inaugurate it to match the birth anniversary of Dr. B.R Ambedkar. As such, the schedules of all activities were squeezed and the formalities of addressing written enquiry of quotation could not be placed. Instead, the vendors were called to the work site and quotations were obtained at site.\n\nThe reply of the Department might not be factually correct as two suppliers were from Rajasthan State and obtained the quotation from them at work site in the absence of the documentary evidence. As stated above, one supplier submitted the rate of CNC cutting in terms of cubic metre whereas the other two in square feet. However, there should not be this sort of contradictory quotation in terms of units of rates in case a clear discussion happened with suppliers either at site or through mail/any other correspondence. Even, it was not clear to Audit how Department decided to take the rate in terms of square feet when written enquiry was not placed to the suppliers.\n\nAs regards the finalization of rate of the sandstone work, the Department submitted that the Consultant furnished the detailed drawing of sandstone in January 2023 with full details of stone carving. As the base rate of sandstone (Ashlar Masonry) was already available in sanction estimate, it was adopted as the base rate to which transport charge was added. For the carving cost, CPWD did not have any rate. Hence, market quotations were obtained which were worked out on the complexity of carving design on square feet bases with CNC Technology. On the consequential conversion of the rate of CNC cutting in terms of cubic metre at ₹143704 per cum from the quotation rate of ₹970 per sft, Department clarified that the size of the sand stone block was 0.00675 cum (0.30x0.30x0.075) and for stone block size of 0.00675 cum, the rate of cutting was ₹970 per sft.\n\nHowever, the fact is that there is no logic to assume that in stone block size of 0.00675 cum, there will be cutting area of 1 square feet without mentioning any depth of cutting in the quotation. Audit therefore suggests the Department to review the revised rate judiciously to avoid the huge cost implication.",

      "content": "#### IV. REVISION OF RATES IN FLOORING WORKS IN VIOLATION OF THE AGREEMENT CONDITIONS\n\nThe work “construction of new secretariat for the State of Telangana in the premises of old secretariat complex” was technically sanctioned (September 2020) for ₹617.00 crore. On call of tenders, the work was awarded (November 2020) to M/s Sharpoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd KPC Projects limited, for an agreement value of ₹514.75 crore at 4.02 percent excess over the ECV for completion in 12 months.\n\nAs per tender conditions/Agreement conditions (Clause 8 bid offer), the tenderers should work out his own rates keeping in view of the work, site conditions and quote his overall percentage with which he intends to execute the work. Agreement conditions (clauses 37 and 39) stipulate that the contractor is to be paid for the quantity of the work done at the estimate rate in the bill of quantity of the work done for each item plus or minus tender percentage. The payment rates for supplemental items which are not covered in the agreement are only to be regulated according to the conditions stipulated in the agreement.\n\nHowever, scrutiny of the records revealed that the rate of the item of work “flooring with high polished granite 16-18mm thick of premium colour (other than black) etc in the ground floor” which was already covered by the agreement at the estimated rate of ₹4796 per sqm, was revised in deviation statement-III (October 2022) at ₹5802.00 per sqm by restructuring the Standard data incorporating (i) additional labour charges for fixing of inlay works and power saw-hand operated hire charges etc and (ii) higher granite material factor of 11.50 sqm in lieu of 10.50 sqm in the Standard data. Standard data (BLD-CSTN-9-7) for flooring with high polished granite does not include these additional cost elements in the Data itself. This maneuvering of data by the Department in violation of the tender/agreement conditions resulted in undue benefit of ₹2.26 crore to the contractor.\n\n\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that in the original estimate, the above item of work was exclusive of inlay works. As per the flooring sample approved by Hon’ble CM, the architect proposed the flooring with high polished granite including inlay works depicting the design pattern other than the agreement specification and issued drawings accordingly. Hence, the rate analysis was prepared considering the labour and machinery charges for inlay works and same was approved in deviation statement.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that there was no agreement condition which can entertain any revision of agreement items. In addition, the inclusion of charges of inlay works and other additional cost elements has no references of any standard data under which Audit can verify the correctness of data of inlay works arrived by the Department. In the similar flooring item in the work of erection of Dr.BR Ambedkar statue, Department had chosen to revise the rate by a different method with the addition of machine cutting charges and taking of material granite factor of 11 sqm in lieu of 10.50 sqm provided in the standard data. Audit opines that it is irregular on the part of Technical Sanctioning Authority/Agreement Concluding Authority to accept the revision of rates in any method agreeable to the contractors, without any enabling agreement conditions or any amendments to the Standard Data.",

Agreement conditions (clause 37) stipulate that the contractor is to be paid for the quantity of the work done at the estimate rate in the bill of quantity of the work done for each item plus or minus tender percentage. The payment rates for supplemental items which are not covered in the agreement are only to be regulated according to the conditions stipulated in the agreement. However, scrutiny of the deviation statement-III revealed that Department kept on revising the rates of flooring, cladding with high polished granite etc on the ground that approved specification for this item differs from the item considered in the technical sanction.\n\nIn the item of the work “ providing cladding with 16 to 18 mm thick High Polished Granite up to 8'-00 (2.43 M) of premium colours (other than black) which was originally sanctioned at ₹4,526 /sqm (lower ground floor rate) ”, Department revised the rate of this agreement item at ₹7,310/sqm by adding the cost of groove of 8mm at the factor of 218.68 Rft and power saw cutter-hand operated hire charges at the factor of 16 hrs. As these cost elements are not provided in the Standard data BLD-CSTN-9-19, inclusion of the same was irregular in the absence of any enabling agreement conditions for revision of agreement items and entailed huge undue benefit ₹ 4.10 crore to the contractor as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that in the original estimate, the rate of the item of the cladding with high polished granite was exclusive of groove making charges. During the execution, the Architect submitted the drawings duly providing grooves to cladding with high polished granite. Accordingly, after several mockup at site, grooves were executed. As there was no approved data for such type of specialized works, observed data was worked out and same was approved in the deviation statement.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that there was no agreement condition which can entertain any revision of agreement items. In addition, the inclusion of groove making charges and other additional cost elements has no references of any standard data under which Audit can verify the correctness of data of groove charges cooked by the Department. The acceptance of the revision of rates in any method agreeable to the contractors, without any agreement conditions or any other amendments to the Standard data by the Technical Sanctioning Authority/Agreement Concluding Authority is irregular.",

FINALISATION OF RATES OF SUSPECTED COMPROMISE\n\nThe work “the construction of new secretariat for the State of Telangana in the premises of old secretariat complex” was technically sanctioned (September 2020) for ₹617.00 crore. On call of tenders, the work was awarded (November 2020) to M/s Sharpoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd, for an agreement value of ₹514.75 crore at 4.02 percent excess over the ECV for completion in 12 months.\n\nScrutiny of the records revealed the followings:\n\n**Finalization of rates of elevators/lifts on suspected compromise**\n\nScope of the work interalia includes the Electromechanical Works for which there was a provision of ₹103.00 crore. Out of the estimate provision of ₹ 103.00 crore, Department allocated ₹ 9.03 crore for providing elevators. The cost of installation of elevators was estimated from the quotations obtained from the two suppliers/firms viz (1) M/s Schindler and (2) M/s Kone Elevators India Pvt Ltd. Verification of the comparative statement revealed that prices offered by the 1st supplier were exclusive of taxes whereas those of the 2nd one was inclusive of GST at 18 percent. If the comparison was done exclusive of taxes, the prices offered by the 2nd one would be lower. The Audit also examined the cost of elevators prescribed in Plinth Area Rates (PAR) 2020 and 2021 of CPWD and rates mentioned in the PAR were inclusive of GST. The prices (inclusive of GST) offered by M/s Kone Private India Ltd were more or less equal to those prescribed in PAR of various elevators.\n\nHowever, the Department considered the higher prices offered by the 1st supplier, which resulted in adoption of higher rates of elevators causing additional financial burden of ₹1.23 crore.\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that the quotation for the elevators was obtained from M/s Schindler and M/s Kone Elevator. After receiving the quotations, discussions were held with both the Agencies for negotiation and clarifications regarding specifications and rates. During the discussion, M/s Kone Elevator submitted that their quotation was erroneously given as inclusive of taxes and submitted another quotation exclusive of taxes. Accordingly, a comparative statement was statement was prepared. The Department also submitted that PAR rates of CPWD are for preparation of budgetary estimates only. As per the PAR rates, the lift specification is not specific regarding MR/MRL, SS car body/MS car body etc. The lifts in the estimate were considered with 1.75 m/s with high end specification which are not covered in the CPWD PAR rates.\n\nThe company M/s Kone Elevator in their offer letter stated that rates were inclusive of GST at 18 percent. The Department’s reply to the discussion being held after quotations were received was also not proper/contradictory as the letter of offer by M/s Kone Elevator was dated 12.09.2020 and their revised letter was also dated 12.09.2020. There was no documentary evidence of the discussion being held with M/s Kone Elevator for negotiation and clarifications on the day the quotation was received.\n\n**Excess provision due to adoption of Hire rates**\n\nOut of the estimate provision of ₹ 103.00 crore towards Electromechanical Works, Department provided ₹ 10.55 crore for providing networking, EPABX System etc. Scrutiny revealed that in case of IP based CCTV estimate, Department obtained the offer letters from three suppliers viz M/s Vashishta System, M/s Atluri & Co and M/s RGP Electronics India Private Ltd. However, the rates adopted by the Department were higher than the lowest offer rates resulting in the excess provision of ₹ 12.70 lakh as illustrated in Annexure-1. Adoption of higher rates are observed in all items of IP based CCTV Estimate.\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that for the CCTV estimate, quotations were obtained from the above three suppliers and a comparative statement was prepared. Overall quotations of M/s Vashishta system, M/s Atluri & Co and M/s RGP Electronics India were ₹ 3,05,50974, ₹3,18,33,592 and ₹3,18,95,019 respectively.\n\nThe reply was not correct as items involved in the quotations were of different specifications and these could be of various approved makes. Therefore, comparison should be done item wise individually. Incorrect comparison resulted in inflation of the estimate and undue benefit to the contractor.",

UNFRUITFUL EXPENDITURE ON CONSULTANCY CHARGES ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MUSEUM AND HELIPAD\n\nGovernment of Telangana proposes to build a modern iconic structure at Road No.12, Banjara Hills for housing the Head Quarters of Hyderabad City Police Commissionerate along with a world class, state of art Command Control Center. It was also envisaged to set up state-of-the-art police museum in the sky Bridges of 14th and 15th floors, which should be opened to the public to understand the evolution and functioning of the Police Department. For setting up the museum as envisioned, the Department had already incurred an expenditure of ₹ 40.32 lakh with an additional commitment of ₹ 10.08 lakh (withheld) towards the Consultancy Charges. However, in the absence of a future plan/fund allocation for the setting up of the Museum, the expenditure incurred on the Consultancy Charges would remain unproductive/wasteful. As seen from the revised administrative sanction (June 2021), the State Home Department did not provide any funds for setting up of the Museum in the new office building. As such, the expenditure of ₹ 50.40 lakh (including the withheld amount) would remain unfruitful.\n\nSimilarly, the Department also planned to have a Helipad on the top of Tower A. For this purpose, an expenditure of ₹13.10 lakh was already spent towards survey, planning, designing & helipad consultancy charges. This proposal was also yet to be materialized as of September 2023.\n\nOn the issue of Consultancy Charges spent, the Department replied that Police Department desired to have a State of art Police Museum in the sky Bridges of 14th and 15th floors of tower A. Accordingly, as per the directions of the Police Department, M/s Lemon Designs Private Limited prepared a detailed design on the proposed museum to the Police Department. And also submitted that, regarding the further work/fund allocation for the setting up of museum, same would be dealt by the Police Department.\n\nAs regards the construction of the Helipad, the Department replied that correspondence was going on between the Police Department and DGCA. The approval was awaited.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that the Consultancy Charges on setting up of museum had become unfruitful as the provision of the fund/future plan was not provided/visible in the modified estimate under submission to the Home Department/Government. As for the construction of the Helipad, implementation of the same remained doubtful as approval was stated to have been awaited.",

EXECUTION OF STAINLESS-STEEL CLADDING WORK\n\nThe Government of Telangana proposes to create a Martyrs Memorial near Lumbini Park, Hyderabad as a mark of respect to those who sacrificed their lives for achieving statehood. State Government accorded (June 2017) Administrative Sanction for ₹80.00 crore for the Memorial work. After calling tenders, the work was entrusted to M/s KPC Projects Ltd for an agreement value of ₹ 66.28 crore at 3.95 percent excess over ECV of ₹63.75 crore. The Government in October 2021 accorded Revised Administrative Sanction of ₹ 177.50 crore keeping in view of the deviations from the scope of the original scope of the work. In original technical sanctioned estimate, Stainless steel cladding (SS cladding) was contemplated with 1.20 mm thick with copper T-joints. However, during execution, seamless SS cladding with 4mm thick sheet was proposed with extra financial burden of ₹ 29.34 crore.\n\nScrutiny revealed that for SS cladding work, Department initially identified M/s JNR Infra for the work after several deliberations (31.12.2019 & 27.5.2020) to achieve the seamless outer finish using latest technology. The consultants engaged for the work (November 2020) reported that based on the past experiences of M/s JNR Infra with foreign acquaintances, the rate of the SS cladding works with 8mm thick stainless steel could be ₹ 88996 per sqm for the main structure work and was expected to get the total cost of SS cladding work to ₹37.93 crore. However, Department later finalized M/s Grantkraft, Dubai for the SS cladding work. In May 2021, Department compared the quotation furnished by 6 firms for the purpose of SS cladding work and proposed for selection of the M/s Grantkraft being the firm quoted the lowest offer. However, the quotations furnished by the firms and comparison thereon were not on equal footings as out of 6 firms, quotations of the 4 firms were rejected as their offers were of partly/fully glazed finished, but not of stainless steel. Of the remaining two firms, M/s Tongling Tongganaflu cultural creative corp offered on the basis of stainless-steel seamless finish 5 mm thick whereas M/s Grantkraft offered on stainless steel seamless polished finish 4 mm thick. M/s Grantkraft was selected between the two firms on the ground that his offer price was lower. However, no records were made available to show that the comparison was made taking the same thickness of steel. Further, M/s NJR who did the display and on his experiences Department worked out the cost of SS cladding work was not in the picture of the comparison of the quotations. As stated, the consultant of the work finalized the total cost of the SS cladding work at ₹ 37.93 crore on the basis of the stainless steel 8mm thick. In the present case, the cost of SS cladding on the offer of the M/s Grantkraft of 4 mm thick stainless steel was coming to ₹ 36.39 crore. In the circumstances stated above, the selection of the M/s Grantkraft was lacking transparency and finalization of the cost of SS cladding work appeared to be inflated hugely.\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that on series of meetings/discussions, one agency M/s NJR Infra was identified by the Consultant. Department was not satisfied with the proposal prepared by M/s NJR Infra. Further, the Hon’ble Chief minister directed to have a seamless finish cladding with stainless steel. Hence the proposal furnished by M/s NJR Infra was not considered. It was further submitted that the requirement of Department was appraised to the Consultant only. The consultant proposed different material i.e. Glass, Tensil fabric and stainless steel. However, the concept design artist elaborated that stainless steel mirror finish was required for the project. As such, out of several global agencies, M/s Grankraft was shortlisted and later their proposal was approved.\n\nHowever, the fact is that the consultant in their letter addressed (23.11.2020) to the Executive Engineer, Central Building Division categorically mentioned that Department identified M/s JNR Infra for the work after several deliberations (31.12.2019 & 27.5.2020) to achieve the seamless outer finish using latest technology. Even the Executive Engineer, Central Building Division wrote a letter (27.11.2020) to the Superintending Engineer (R&B), Headquarter circle to arrange for obtaining the revised estimate which included the cost of SS cladding work estimated based on experiences of M/s JNR Infra and their foreign. No document was made available to Audit to show that M/s JNR Infra was not qualified to execute the work and no written reason was not on record why their economical proposal was not considered, by putting up in the comparative statement. Main concern of the Audit here is that the selection of the agency for execution of the SS cladding lacked transparency and attempt to receive the competitive and economical offers from the various equally qualified agencies/firms was missing. As stated above, the comparison of offers by various agencies/firms was not equal footing.",

FIXATION OF COST OF ELEVATORS WITHOUT OBTAINING MARKET RATES FROM THE SUPPLIERS\n\nIn the work “Construction of Hyderabad City Police Commissionerate Head Quarters and Integrated Command & Control Centre at Banjara Hills, Rd No 12, Hyderabad”, there was a provision of ₹8.05 crore towards providing lifts/elevators. Scrutiny of records revealed that provision was made on the basis of the quotation furnished by the M/s Kone Elevators India Pvt Ltd. However, in the Revised Estimate, the cost of the providing lifts/elevators was increased to ₹ 13.37 crore, which was more than the original cost by ₹5.31 crore. On enquiry in Audit as to how the agreed rates was revised drastically, Department informed that as per site requirements, and in view of the proposed helipad over the building, it was necessitated to execute machine room less elevators for height restriction of head room. Hence, all the elevators had been changed from machine room elevators to machine room less elevators. It was also submitted that during the review meeting on 10.08.2017 with Police Authorities, a decision was taken to provide elevators with 2400 mm door height as against the original 2000mm specified in the agreement. Also, full glass doors elevators in Tower-A and Tower-B were proposed for safety, security and to match the ambience of the lift lobby. The Project Management Consultant reviewed the cost escalation amount on account of above variations with manufacturer M/s Schindler Elevators and recommended additional cost implication.\n\nHowever, the matter of fixation of revised cost of elevators with revised specifications was not transparent and fixation of price on the negotiation table with a particular supplier without assessing the competitive prices from the open market was highly irregular. Further, M/s Schindler Elevators only provided the differential amount on account of revised specification over the original agreement amount. It did not provide the rate of the elevators as a whole as per revised specifications. In case of consideration of part of the original agreed amount of elevators, the Department should also deduct the Embedded Taxes as the earlier rate was inclusive of VAT at 5% and service tax at 14.5% on 40% of the value.",

This resulted in inflation of estimate by ₹ 2.73 crore.\n\n\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department noted that there was variation in quantities taken in the estimate due to oversight  in respect of TCS 5 and TCS-7. It was further replied that the project was tendered on EPC mode wherein the estimates and rate analysis are not part of the tender documents.

The consequent inflation of estimate was ₹2.24 crore as shown below;\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in the estimate for laying of Bituminous Concrete (BC) also, Department adopted the charges incorrectly towards hire charge of Smooth wheeled roller 8-10 tonnes and overhead charges resulting in adoption of higher rates by ₹275.00 per cum in grading I materials and ₹ 273.00 per cum in grading II materials as shown in Annexure-4. This resulted in boosting of estimate by ₹1.09 crore as shown below.\n\n\n\nThus, due to adoption of higher rates in the above two items of work, the estimate was inflated by   ₹ 3.33 crore.\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that  as per the PMC contract agreement Clause 7.1.1, the Consultant is  responsible for accuracy of the data collected by him directly or procured from other agencies/authorities, the designs, drawings, estimates and all other details prepared by him as part of these services. The Department stated that as per the explanation submitted by the consultant, they adopted the rates as per practical and realistic conditions. It was submitted that rate of vibratory roller was adopted in lieu of the rate of smooth wheeled roller and 5% over head charges was adopted as per general engineering practice. The Department further replied that the project was tendered on EPC mode wherein the estimates and rate analysis are not part of the tender documents. The DPR submitted by the consultant gave only the estimate project cost and actual payment to the contractor would be based on actual work done by the contractor at tender rates quoted by him and not based on the rates adopted in the estimates. In the instant case, the EPC contractor quoted 36.32 percent   less than the estimate cost value.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that the project cost was inflated on account of the incorrect inclusion machinery rate and higher overhead charges. The Department should take the rate as provided in SoR and should give a better picture of the project cost to the Government while submitting the project proposal so that project cost sanctioned by the Government was not inflated.",

It  also  took the overhead charges at 5 percent  in lieu of  3 percent applicable for road works.  Due to adoption of incorrect charges/rate, unit  rate of the above item of work  was worked out  at ₹2587.00 per cum instead of ₹ 2533.00 per cum (Annexure-5). Consequent inflation of estimate of  ₹0.98 crore is shown below.\n\n.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in the rate analysis for  laying of wet mix macadam (WMM) also, Department committed same mistake resulting in adoption of rates higher by ₹68.00 per cum    (Annexure-6).\n\nThis resulted in undue benefit to the contractor to the extent of ₹1.69 crore as shown below.\n\n\n\nThus, due to the adoption of higher rates in the above two items of work, the Department inflated the estimate by ₹ 2.67 crore to the contractor.\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that as per the PMC contract agreement Clause 7.1.1, the Consultant is  responsible for accuracy of the data collected by him directly or procured from other agencies/authorities, the designs, drawings, estimates and all other details prepared by him as part of these services.

NON-DEDUCTION OF EMBEDDED TAX\n\nAfter introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) (July 2017), the Works Contracts were being subjected to GST at the rate of 12 per cent/18 per cent. Thus, to avoid GST on the Taxes already included in the cost of works, the Government of Telangana issued (July 2018) orders vide GO Ms.No.67 of I&CAD (Reforms) Department, dated 04 July 2018  that in respect of the works done after 01 July 2017, the taxes already embedded in the rates/materials under the existing contracts should be deducted and to the net value of work so arrived at, GST at the rates applicable from time to time should be added while making payments to contractors.\n\nIn the work “Construction of Hyderabad City Police Commissionerate Head Quarters and Integrated Command & Control Centre at Banjara Hills, Rd No 12, Hyderabad” Department worked out the Embedded Tax to be deducted from the material cost and arrived at ₹25,22,74,603. However, on test check revealed that Department left out items of main building work (approx. cost ₹9.25 crore) from the ambit of the Embedded Tax deduction criteria and reasons for the same were not on record and made available to Audit.  The non consideration of Embedded Tax was an undue benefit to the contractor.\n\n\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that there was no clarity on the taxes embedded on the items considered, whose rates were derived from the Delhi Schedule of Rates. However, the Embedded Taxes for these items would be deducted as per the Embedded Taxes included for the similar SoR items.\n\nThe fact of the deduction of Embedded Tax may be furnished to Audit along with the calculation sheet for verification.",

INCORRECT PREPARATION OF CONSULTANCY BILL\n\nState Government accorded Administrative Sanction (May 2017) for an amount of ₹843.50 crore towards construction of 26 number of Integrated District Office Complexes (IDOCs) in Phase I. Subsequently the Government granted Revised Administrative Sanction (September 2020) for ₹1365.62 crore against the Original Administrative Sanction of ₹843.50 crore for 25 IDOCs (except Warangal Rural). In connection with the implementation of the Project, Government entrusted (July 2017) M/s Usha Reddy, Architects for providing Consultancy Service for the above proposed Projects (26 no of IDOCs). The main objective of the consultant is to prepare site layout plan with contours, detailed plans, estimates, structural designs for all civil, electrical, work supply and sanitary arrangements and site development plans and layout plan for the entire campuses etc. As per agreed schedule of price “3% of construction cost of North facing and east facing complex each and 1% of construction cost for other IDOCs i.e. for 24 Districts plus Service Tax”.\n\nOn test check of records of two IDOCs, Audit observed that an amount of ₹39,90,912 was provided towards Consultancy Charge in respect of IDOC Mahbubnagar, whereas an amount of ₹43,24,020 was provided for IDOC Nagar Kurnool.  Department in Circular Memo no. ENC (B)/DEE 1/AEE3/IDOC-Consultants fee/2021-22 dated 04.04.2021 issued instructions to exclude Price Adjustment amount, QC charges, NAC, payment to the finished products like borewells, pump sets etc.  from the construction cost for the purpose of payment to the consultant. Further Department in 2nd circular memo dated 11.10.2021 instructed to exclude the provisions of streetlights.  However, scrutiny of payment statements of consultancy charges in respect of two IDOCs (upto 2nd and 3rd bills respectively) revealed that provision of Price Adjustment was included in the Construction Cost of both cases which entailed excess payment to the consultant.\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that Price Adjustment provisions were not considered in calculating the subsequent 3rd bill of IDOC Nagar Kurnool and 4th bill of IDOC Mahbubnagar.\n\nHowever, the correctness of the adjustments of excess payments could not be confirmed in Audit in the absence of the actual payment made to the consultants in the previous bills. For instance, in IDOC Nagar Kurnool, as per adjustment statement, consultants submitted 1st bill payment including GST amounting to ₹13,40,414 whereas Department took it as ₹12,13,202. Similarly in 2nd bill, Department took it as ₹7,27,921 against the consultant’s declaration of ₹8,04,248.  Same was the case with IDOC, Mahbubnagar.\n\nThe details of payment as stated in the reply may be furnished for verification in the next Audit.",

The Parties also acknowledge and agree that the conditions specified in this Clause 8.2 (iii) shall not be modified or waived by either Party.  On calling for information on LA, the Department informed that total extent of LA involved in the project was 106.33 acre for which awards are under preparation by the respective LA Authorities (RDOs). No disbursement was made to the beneficiaries till date.\n\nHowever, even after lapse of two years since requisition to RDO, no funds were deposited with RDO, Medak and Siddipet and no single acre was acquired.  This would hamper the progress of the work and delay in completion of the work.\n\n**Diversion of Forest land**\n\nThere was a provision of ₹8.00 crore towards diversion of forest land.  As per the information furnished to Audit, the extent of forest land diversion required was 9.355 ha. and the Department had to yet obtain Stage-1 clearance from the Forest Department. It was also submitted that no payment was made to the Forest Department in connection with the diversion of forest land.\n\nEven after one year had lapsed from the date of agreement, Stage-I clearance is still pending.  This would hamper the progress of work and delay in completion of works.\n\n**Shifting of Utilities**\n\nA huge amount of ₹59.79 crore was provided towards shifting of utilities in the estimate.  When the details of shifting of utilities called for, the Department replied that the shifting of utility works is in progress and expenditure of ₹ 19.76 core was incurred so far.\n\nAs the financial progress on the work was 33 percent only, the Department should put in efforts to shift the remaining utilities for smooth progress of work.\n\n**Compensation for structures (Rehabilitation and resettlement)**\n\nA provision of ₹19.20 crore was made towards payment of compensation for Buildings and structures etc., to secure the Right of Way. When the details of amount utilized for the purpose payment of compensation was called for, the Department replied that so far no compensation was paid for the structures/Buildings.\n\nNonpayment of compensation and non-acquisition of structures/Buildings would hamper the progress of works and completion of the work in time.",

EXCESS PROVISION TOWARDS MAINTENANCE CHARGE.\n\nThe work “Widening to two lanes with paved shoulders from Km 0/000 to Km 79/300 of Kalwakurthy – Kollapur section NH – 167 in the State of Telangana was entrusted (April 2023) to M/s RKIPL-KMV(JV) for an agreement amount of ₹ 401.11 crore under EPC system of contract for completion in 24 months from the date of agreement.\n\nAs per para 14.1 of EPC contract agreement, maintenance charge at 2.5 percent is to be made in the estimate viz Nil for 1st year, 0.50 percent of contract price each for the second, third and fourth years & 1 percent of the contract price for the 5th year.  On scrutiny of the estimate of the above work, Audit observed that an amount of ₹ 145855496.63 was made towards maintenance charge for 5 years instead of ₹130228121.99 i.e 2.5 percent of Total Civil Construction Cost of ₹5209124879.78. Thus, an amount of ₹15627374.64 (₹145855496.63- ₹ 130228121.99) was provided in excess towards maintenance charge in contrary to the aforementioned contract clause.\n\nOn this being pointed out, the Department replied that maintenance charges at 2.5 percent were calculated on the cost of Civil Construction Work including GST.\n```The reply of the Department was not tenable as the maintenance charge of 2.5 percent was to be calculated on Civil Construction Cost only. Department provided the maintenance charge at 2.5 percent on Civil Cost only in other two test checked NH Works.\n\n## अस्वीकारोक्ति\n\n“O/o The Engineer-In-Chief, R&B, NH, CRF & Buildings, Erramanzil, Hyderabad, Telangana State.” द्वारा दियेगये सूचनाके आधारपर निरीक्षण प्रतिवेदन तैयारकियागयाहै लेखापरीक्षीत की ओरसे गलत सूचना एवं गैरसूचना के लिए महालेखाकार (लेखापरीक्षा) तेलंगाना, हैदराबाद भागीदारनहींहोंगे.\n\n## “D I S C L A I M E R”\n\nThe Inspection Report has been prepared on the basis of information furnished by the “O/o The Engineer-In-Chief, R&B, NH, CRF & Buildings, Erramanzil, Hyderabad Telangana State”.
